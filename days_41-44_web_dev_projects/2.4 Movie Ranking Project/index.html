<h1>Best Movies According to Scott</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>

<hr />
<h3>The Martian</h3>

<p>I love how it blends science, humour, and survival.
It's clever but easy to watch, and Matt Damon makes the whole thing fun.</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>

<p></p>A beautifully made sci-fi film that focuses on language, communication,
and human connection rather than explosions. Stunning atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Paddington 2</h3>

<p>Pure joy.
Warm-hearted, funny, beautifully acted — and genuinely one of the best-reviewed films ever made.</p><!-- Write your code below -->
